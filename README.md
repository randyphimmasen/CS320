1.How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To make sure my software is both functional and secure, I took a structured approach to testing. I create detailed unit tests that not only handle the usual cases but also account for edge cases to ensure that everything works as expected, no matter the situation. I also prioritize security by including things like input validation and error handling to protect against issues like invalid data or unauthorized access. Throughout the process, I consistently check the project requirements to ensure my tests are addressing key system needs, such as resolving scheduling conflicts or handling deadlines.

2.How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Understanding user needs means really diving into the project requirements and thinking through how users will interact with the system. In the DriverPass project, for instance, I knew that preventing overlapping appointments was a big priority, so I wrote tests to catch scheduling conflicts. I also made sure that tasks without deadlines were rejected to align with what users expected from the task service. By constantly referring back to the user stories and requirements, I was able to develop a system that wasn’t just functional but also intuitive and user-friendly.

3.How do I approach designing software?
When it comes to designing software, I like to break down the project into smaller, manageable pieces and then create unit tests for each one. I rely on UML diagrams to get a clear picture of how the system is structured, which helps me understand how different components will interact. I also focus on writing code that’s not only effective but also easy to maintain, cutting out unnecessary complexity. Looking ahead, I want to expand my use of integration and system testing to ensure that the entire system works seamlessly, especially as different services become more interconnected.
